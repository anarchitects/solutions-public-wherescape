# solutions-public-wherescape
Congratulations you've stumbled across our repo full of stuff that we've built for [WhereScape](https://www.wherescape.com) software that we are happy to share for free because we are so awesome and nice!

If you have a particular problem that you need a solution for and think we could help then please do get in touch and we can have a discussion about how we might be able to help. Obviously what we put here is provided free but building a solution just for you will likely incur a cost.

To find out who we are and what we do just head on over to [our website](https://www.anarchitects.io/).

# DISCLAIMER 1
We are not full time Powershell, Python, Java, A.N.Other Scripting language professionals so if you are looking for fully polished "perfectly written" scripts then you might be in the wrong place. When we come up against something that requires a funky solution or just something that we think would be fun or cool to develop we will do so and the resulting code will end up here. Yes most scripts will start out written "inline" style rather than object oriented but over time we will strive to convert them into such aesthetically pleasing formats. If in the meantime you would like to have a crack at doing just that then do let us know as we would love to have a community of like minded and equally awesome people contributing to this content.

# DISCLAIMER 2
All solutions in this repository are used at your own risk. We will not be held responsible for any damage to your environment caused by using any of our solutions. We of course endeavour to develop them in such a way that they will not cause any harm to yuour environment or code base however some solutions will undoubtedly contain metadata updates that you should check and test thoroughly before making use of them.
